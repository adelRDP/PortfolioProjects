# Here Goes the Dashboards I created using Power BI!

- ### 1. Covid dataset Dashboard
  - In this one, I used the dataset which I *Explored* before in the *[SQL Data Exploratory Project](SQLProjects/CovidDataExploration.sql)*
  - I used Power BI to make a Map Chart, a Bar Chart, a Line Chart and a Card.
  - I Showed Total death and infection Stats, Infection Rate and Count by Country on the map, also over time for Top 5 Countries(by infection count)
  - Also Showed how many people Died in total by Continent, using a Bar Chart
