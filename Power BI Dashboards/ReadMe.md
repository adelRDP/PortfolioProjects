# Here Goes the Dashboards I created using Power BI!


- ### 1. Plants Co. Performance Report (YTD vs Prior Year To Date)
  - How did they Perform in : 1- **Sales** 2- **Gross Profit** 3- **Quantity** of Plants sold?
  - Where are the areas they are performing well? Where do they need to make some adjustments? (We showed Top 5 and Bottom 5 Countires)
  - Breaking down the *Ups and Downs* by **Month**, **Country**, **Product Type** and **Product Name** with a Waterfall chart so we can easily understant **What is the driving factor** behind the company's success or failure.
  - Who are the main source of their **Gross Margin**? Showing the distribution of customers by Gross Margin they provide for the company(scatter plot)

- ### 2. Covid dataset Dashboard
  - In this one, I used the dataset which I *Explored* before in the *[SQL Data Exploratory Project](/SQLProjects/CovidDataExploration.sql)*
  - I used Power BI to make a Map Chart, a Bar Chart, a Line Chart and a Card.
  - I Showed Total death and infection Stats, Infection Rate and Count by Country on the map, also over time for Top 5 Countries(by infection count)
  - Also Showed how many people Died in total by Continent, using a Bar Chart
